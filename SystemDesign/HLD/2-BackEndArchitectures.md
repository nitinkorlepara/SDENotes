# BackEnd Architectures

### Monolithic Architecture

- Monolithic pattern where the application created would have the UI and data access code in a single program.
- Single codebase and single build system.
- Deployment and testing are simple.
- Tightly coupled and poor reliability.
- Lack of flexibility.

### Microservice Architecture

- Allow organization to reduce dependencies, develop faster and scale.
-

### Service-Oriented Architecture

- Structured Apps into isolated, reusable services that communicate thrugh common communication standards.
- service interface provide loose coupling between services
- Services are exposed using standard protocols such as SOAP,REST to exhange data.
  - ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) transformations of data models, handles connectivity, performs routing.
